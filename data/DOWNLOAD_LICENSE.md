# Forgotten Runes Wizards Cult Wizard Parts

# Wizard: **WIZARD_NAME**

## How to Use

The attached images are part of The Forgotten Runes Wizard's Cult. It contains the parts and flattened layers of the Wizard "**WIZARD_NAME**" in three different sizes: 50x50, 400x400, and 1024x1024.

The Wizards are naturally 50x50 pixel images. If you plan to make edits, our recommendation is to use the 50x50 version, because it's easier to change pixels.

When you export, you should scale up the image, but you need to use what's called "nearest neighbor" scaling, which helps keep the pixel art edges crisp.

We recommend using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for editing pixel art. It's a fantastic tool that is easy to use and supports layers and animation. It's also a lot of fun to use. But you can also use Photoshop or any other tool you prefer.
